Code and data for Willard et al. 2019 manuscript.
Physiology boxplots were generated with excel and the details for those plots are found in excel spreadsheets in each figure's data folder e.g. "./fig1/data/Figure_1_boxplots.xlsx."
The code and data required for re-processing and generating all other figure panels is organized by figure and summarized in file such as ./fig1/code/aw2018_figure_1.m'. Code was tested in MATLAB 2018a.
Common .m files required for figure re-processing are included in './dependencies' .
A spreadsheet with single unit measurements for all units in the study can be found in './common_data' .
